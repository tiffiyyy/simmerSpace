# SimmerSpace

Welcome to SimmerSpace- a digital cooking companion that helps individuals connect with their Vietnamese heritage. This app combines nostalgia and family-style recipes with modern cooking aids (step-by-step guidance, timers, and videos) to keep cultural traditions alive while making cooking approachable. <br/>

## Tech Stuff ! 

As for the more technical details~ this Apple Vision Pro (APV) app was developed using React, Vite, and TypeScript. We also used the WebSpatial SDK to transform our simple website into a 3D web extraordinaire! <br/>

Despite being fairly new to the XR (extended reality) scene, as a team of rising sophomores at Santa Clara University and a junior in high school, developing this APV app has been much more simple than we could have ever expected. By cross applying our web dev skills, we are on our way to completely developing this app end-to-end within just three weeks!! <br/><br/>
